PHP V7.04 Electronic Signature API

Electronic Signature API based on Joomla, Wordpress, HTML or whatever CMS you would like to place it in.

API is based on CodeIgniter and it comes with a License Number to work, here is the code,
but without the license number it will be useless as it's getting an external code

BaseUriInfo {
web_access_point (string): The access point from where Document Cloud website can be be accessed.,
api_access_point (string): The access point from where other APIs need to be accessed. In case other APIs are accessed from a different end point, it will be considered an invalid request.
}

NO_ACCESS_TOKEN_HEADER: Access token header not provided.

(Base URL: https://api.na1.echosign.com/api/rest/v5 , API Version: 5.0.0 )
